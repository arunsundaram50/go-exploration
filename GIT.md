### 1. **Repository Setup**
- You created the repository on GitHub and sent Person B an invitation. Ensure that:
  - Person B accepts the invitation.
  - Youâ€™ve granted them write or maintain permissions to the repository.

### 2. **Clone the Repository**
- Use the **HTTPS** or **SSH** URL to clone the repository.

  For HTTPS:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
  ```
  For SSH:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
  ```
  Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `REPO_NAME` with the repository name.

---

### 3. **Check Remote**
Ensure the repository URL is set up correctly in your local repository. Run:
```bash
git remote -v
```
It should display the correct URL for the `origin`. If not, set it:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

---

### 4. **Make Changes Locally**
- Make some changes in your repository (e.g., create a new file):
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, Go!" > hello.go
  ```
- Stage the changes:
  ```bash
  git add hello.go
  ```
- Commit the changes:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add hello.go"
  ```

---

### 5. **Push Changes**
Attempt to push changes to the repository:
```bash
git push origin main
```

If `main` is not the branch name, replace it with the correct branch (e.g., `master`).

---

### 6. **Common Issues and Fixes**
#### Issue: Authentication Failed
- **For HTTPS:** Ensure you are logged in to GitHub CLI or have a Personal Access Token (PAT) set up. If not, configure a token:
  - Create a PAT in GitHub (Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens).
  - Use the token when prompted for a password during `git push`.

- **For SSH:** Ensure your SSH key is added to GitHub:
  - Check if you have an SSH key: `ls ~/.ssh`
  - If not, generate one: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`
  - Add the key to GitHub (Settings > SSH and GPG keys).

#### Issue: Permission Denied
- Ensure Person B has accepted the invitation and has write access.

#### Issue: Branch Protection
- Check if the branch is protected on GitHub. If branch protection rules are enabled, you may need to create a pull request instead of directly pushing to `main`.

#### Issue: Repository Not Synced
- If Person B pushed changes and you haven't pulled them, you'll encounter conflicts. Pull their changes first:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```
  Then resolve any merge conflicts, commit, and push again.

---

### 7. **Collaboration Workflow (Best Practices)**
- Use branches for development:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/my-feature
  ```
- Push the branch:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/my-feature
  ```
- Create pull requests on GitHub to merge changes into the `main` branch. This ensures both of you review changes before integrating them.

When `git push` asks for a username, it typically means you're using the HTTPS URL for the repository, and Git is trying to authenticate your GitHub account. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

---

### 1. **Check Your Repository URL**
Run the following command to see the remote URL of your repository:
```bash
git remote -v
```
If it starts with `https://`, it will prompt for a username and password (or Personal Access Token).

If you'd like to avoid this and prefer SSH for authentication (no need for username/password prompts), you can change it:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```
Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `REPO_NAME` with the repository name.

---

### 2. **Set Up Personal Access Token (For HTTPS)**
If you want to continue using HTTPS:
1. Go to **GitHub** > **Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Personal Access Tokens** > **Tokens (classic)** > **Generate new token**.
   - Choose the scopes you need (e.g., `repo` for repository access).
   - Copy the token (you won't see it again).
2. Use the token as the password when prompted by Git:
   - **Username**: Your GitHub username.
   - **Password**: Your Personal Access Token.

Alternatively, you can cache your credentials so you don't have to enter them every time:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```
This will store your credentials in plaintext on your machine.

---

### 3. **Set Up SSH Key**
For a more secure and username-free experience, set up SSH:
1. **Generate an SSH Key** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Save it to the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) and optionally add a passphrase.

2. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**:
   - Copy the key to your clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - Go to **GitHub** > **Settings** > **SSH and GPG Keys** > **New SSH Key**.
   - Paste the key and save.

3. **Test the SSH Connection**:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   You should see a success message.

4. **Change the Remote URL to SSH**:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   ```

---

### 4. **Try Pushing Again**
Now, when you run:
```bash
git push origin main
```
- If you're using SSH, it will authenticate without asking for a username or password.
- If you're using HTTPS, it will cache your credentials or use the token.
